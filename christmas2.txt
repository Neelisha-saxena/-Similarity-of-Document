Introduction: Christmas is an annual festival celebrated in remembrance of the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a major Christian Festival. Though in some places, Christmas is also celebrated by Non-Christians.

Why do we celebrate Christmas? The birthday of Jesus Christ, the great founder of the Christian faith, falls on 25th of December. Christians believe Jesus Christ to be the son and messenger of God. He is the light of the world. Christians believe that if they follow Jesus, then he will remove all the darkness of their life with his light. Hence, we celebrate Christmas Festival on this day.
