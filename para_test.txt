A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of many sentences. They are usually between four to eight sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again; this makes telling when one paragraph ends and another begins easier.
In most organized forms of writing, such as essays, paragraphs contain a topic sentence . This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about. Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a thesis statement, which is the central idea of the essay.
A pilcrow mark (Â¶) is sometimes used to show where a paragraph begins.
