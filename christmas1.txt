Christmas is one of the most popular festivals worldwide. It is celebrated on 25th December every year, but the celebrations start well in advance. It is celebrated in the honour of the lord Jesus Christ as he was born on this day to mother Mary. Jesus lived an exemplary life and taught everyone to follow the path of goodness; he taught people to believe in the almighty and perform good deeds. The life led by Jesus is an example that must be followed by everyone for attaining salvation and for living in harmony on this earth.
